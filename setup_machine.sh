# --- Docker Compose Installation ---
# Refer to: https://github.com/docker/compose
# Rename the relevant binary for your OS to docker-compose & copy it to

# Or to install it system-wide, copy it into 1 of these folders:
# /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins OR /usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins
# /usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins OR /usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins
# (might require making the downloaded file executable with chmod +x)

# Also Note: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-22-04
# Note: Starting with Docker Compose v2, Docker has migrated towards using the 
# compose CLI plugin command (& away from the original docker-compose as 
# documented in our previous Ubuntu 20.04 version of this tutorial. While the 
# installation differs, in general the actual usage involves dropping the hyphen
# from docker-compose calls to become docker compose. For full compatibility 
# details, check the official Docker documentation on command compatibility 
# between the new compose & the old docker-compose.

# & runs the See Stuff web app).
