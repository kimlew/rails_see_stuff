# See Stuff README

This migrates a previous Rails project that used Ruby 2.6.1, Rails 5.2.4.3 and SQLite to these versions and their dependencies:

- Rails 7.0
- Ruby 3.0.1
- SQLite3
- Puma 5.6

The application is a view-only site. It does NOT use Rails scaffolding, i.e., does NOT include the standard CRUD actions.

See a deployed version at: <https://rails-see-stuff.herokuapp.com/>

## To run the application:

1. git clone git@github.com:kimlew/rails_see_stuff.git

2. Install the newer package versions listed above.

3. Go to the browser address: <http://localhost:3000/>
